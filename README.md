Simple Data Structure
=====================

	It is a simple data structure library which provides QUEUE, STACK and RING 
(Circular Buffer) APIs.

Have the code
-------------

You can have it from the Github: [https://github.com/starnight/simple-data-structure](https://github.com/starnight/simple-data-structure, "Simple Date Sturcture")

Or, clone the source code from Github.

```
git clone git://github.com/starnight/simple-data-structure.git
```

Demo usage
----------

	Before compile this library, you must have the compiler GCC, of course.  
There is a demo code which is 'demo.c'.  You can just use the 'make' utility
which will compile the codes according to the 'Makefile'.  Then execute the
program 'demo.bin' for demo.  I also use the program to test the APIs I wrote
working right or wrong.

```
$ make
$ ./demo.bin
```
